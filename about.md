title: About

I'm a macadmin at a branch campus of a larger University in the Midwest, and while I have a lot of thoughts about everything, I don't have a lot to say unless I think it can be useful to someone else.

I've been running our Jamf server for nearly a decade - long enough for my hair and beard to start going grey - and have had to work around a number of shortcomings in our MDM setup as well as within macOS. 

Stick around and see if I surprise us both and know something useful.
