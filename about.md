I have a lot of thoughts about the state of technology in higher education as well as the direction things are headed, but I don't have a lot to say unless I think it can be useful to someone else. 

I've been running our Jamf server for nearly a decade - long enough for my hair and beard to start going grey - and have had to work around a number of shortcomings in our MDM setup as well as within macOS. My workarounds work for me, and they may work for you as well, but it would be better if the problem was solved by the vendors in all cases.

I am going to try not to get all rant-y, which could be a welcome change.  Stick around and see if I surprise us both and know something useful.
