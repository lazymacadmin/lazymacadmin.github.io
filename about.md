I have a lot of thoughts about the state of technology in higher education as well as the direction things are headed, but I don't have a lot to say unless I think it can be useful to someone else. 

I've been running our Jamf server for nearly a decade - long enough for my hair and beard to start going grey - and have had to work around a number of shortcomings in our MDM setup as well as within macOS. 

Stick around and see if I surprise us both and know something useful.
