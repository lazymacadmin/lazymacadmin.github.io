#### **Overview of Jamf Patch Management**

Jamf's Patch Management is, on paper, a dream for an admin. Curated definitions of all versions for a given software. The ability to have one or more patch policies to distribute a given version to a given group. The ability to pop up a notification, then close the app and update it. When it's described to you, it comes across as the perfect solution to keeping all of the apps in your fleet up to date.

And it can be, but out of the box here is the typical workflow.
- Download an app or installer in .dmg or .pkg format
  - If a .dmg, use Composer or your favorite packaging tool to create a .pkg installer
- Upload the installer package to your Jamf distribution point
- Go to Patch Management and select the patch title
- Go to the Definition tab, edit, and manually select the package that coincides with each or any version(s)
- Save the Patch title, go to the Patch Policies tab and create or select the Patch Policy
- Enter a patch policy name, select the version to deploy, decide if you want to prompt users to manually install the patch, add machines on the Scope tab, and customize the user interaction to suit your tastes
- Move on to the next app on your list

That doesn't sound too bad, if patching is your only job. But for the rest of us, you could be looking at 10-15 minutes of manual work per app. And it will need to be done for. every. version.<br>

#### **Automating Patch**

The key to improving Patch is automating everything we can. Package creation? Automate with [Autopkg](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg). There a ton of people who use and [describe](https://amsys.co.uk/introduction-autopkg-2) how to use autopkg, so I'm not going to get too far into the weeds on that. There are still more ways to automatically run autopkg [from a script](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/category/autopkg-conductor/) or [from a repository](https://grahamrpugh.com/2020/07/10/gitlab-runner-and-autopkg.html). And if you use some obscure piece of software that isn't Jamf's patch catalog or you want to maintain your own definitions, well, there's an [autopkg processor](https://github.com/lazymacadmin/UpdateTitleEditor/blob/main/Processor/UpdateTitleEditor.py) for that too.

And that gets us to an advanced, autopatching workflow. Using autopkg, Graham Pugh's [JamfUploader](https://github.com/autopkg/grahampugh-recipes/tree/main/JamfUploaderProcessors) processors to extend autopkg by [uploading built packages](https://github.com/autopkg/grahampugh-recipes/blob/main/JamfUploaderProcessors/JamfPackageUploader.py) automatically and [updating patch policies](https://github.com/autopkg/grahampugh-recipes/blob/main/JamfUploaderProcessors/JamfPatchUploader.py), we can set ourselves up to automate the whole process.

Here is what those steps will look like:
- Use `autopkg search` to find recipes
  - Write any recipes needed (i.e. `.jamf` recipes)
- `autopkg make-override` for each .recipe
- Modify the overrides with the variables we need for our own setup
- Create templates for any policies/patch policies, and harvest any needed icon files
- Run autopkg and watch your workload drop

Yes it takes time to set this all up, but the important part is this: Only the final step needs to be done repeatedly, freeing up your time for other tasks because you ~~never have to touch Jamf Patch Management again~~ only have to touch Patch in specific circumstances.

This is where PI111395 (updating the patch policies via the API has a different timing for when the patch policies recalculate their scope to then deploy) rears it's head. So how is the timing changed? 
> Currently it can vary depending on various factors like the number of scoped devices or other patch policies running as well but in general, we've seen that the Patch Policies recalculate their scope the Macs update inventory AND THEN check-in. We could maybe speed that up by running  2 `sudo jamf recon` commands on the Macs."[^1]

So when do we need to manually touch patch policies? Well, for most patches, a slight delay in deployment isnâ€™t the end of the world. For patches with CVEs or where there is a business need for the latest and greatest, there is a workaround: manually edit and save those patch policies in the gui.

#### **TL;DR**

Autopkg and the referenced processors can make your automated Patch workflow as simple as:
- autopkg run [SampleApp.jamf](https://github.com/lazymacadmin/UpdateTitleEditor/blob/main/AutopatchSampleRecipes/SampleApp.jamf.recipe.yaml)
- autopkg run [Sleep](https://github.com/onecheapgeek/UpdateTitleEditor/blob/main/AutopatchSampleRecipes/Sleep.recipe.yaml) (if using Title Editor, so your Jamf server catches the new version)
- autopkg run [SampleApp.patch](https://github.com/lazymacadmin/UpdateTitleEditor/blob/main/AutopatchSampleRecipes/SampleApp.patch.recipe.yaml)

For multiple recipes, create a recipe list file with one per line and your automation can be as simple as a LaunchAgent running `autopkg run -l recipeList.txt` on a schedule. That's it - autopatching with autopkg and Jamf's Patch Management. I'm cheesy, so I call it **_autopatchg_**.

And here's how it looks when complete:
```zsh
% autopkg run Edge.jamf Sleep Edge.patch

The following policies were created or updated in Jamf Pro:
