It's hard to believe it's been 11 months since I moved away from being a Macadmin, and from tech entirely. Now, as the one year anniversary looms, it is time for me to step back from maintaining [UpdateTitleEditor and my other autopkg processors.](https://github.com/lazymacadmin/UpdateTitleEditor) 

The first step in this process will be placing a notice on the repository that is it unmaintained. I will also disable issues and no longer accept pull requests. 

It all still works, as far as I can tell, but my ability to carry it forward is extraordinarily limited. My time is too valuable to spend my evenings on it instead of being with my family, and my ability to support Jamf is harder and harder the longer I am away from my old job. I just can't remember the things I used to know so well.

I may archive the [repository](https://github.com/lazymacadmin/UpdateTitleEditor) in the near future, possibly on the one year anniversary of starting my new career, assuming I remember to. Let's not hold our collective breaths.

Here's hoping someone will pick up the reins and either continue to maintain it, or re-write it and improve it. Either way, it's time for me to move on.
