Today is Valentine's Day, so it seems somewhat appropriate to post a love letter of sorts to our fabulous community.

I'm not the same person I was 12 years ago. I've undergone a lot of growth, personally and professionally. The Mac Admin community also isn't the same. It's larger and in some ways warmer and more welcoming (apparently, so am I - thank you, therapy). We have more access to resources and professional development, and even have a pretty kick-ass [foundation](https://www.macadmins.org) leading the charge with opportunities and advocacy for the members of our community.

The Apple ecosystem has grown to include new products, opportunities, and challenges. And while I have grown with it, the time has come for me to move on to other ventures. In just over 2 weeks, I am leaving the Mac admin community to pursue options in another field. I don't feel like the direction technology is moving works well for me. It's been a feeling I've been feeling for a while, but was recently summed up perfectly by a toot:

<p></p>

Of course it isn't as simple as an aging techie yearning for the good old days (and yes, it hurts to call myself aging), but some of those other factors are specific to my soon-to-be former employer and changes coming to my position, and I don't want to dwell on things that aren't going to matter in a few short weeks.

My employer will be looking to fill my position. If you're in the Greater Cincinnati-area and want to work at a higher-ed institution with benefits like tuition remission and a chance to work at a branch campus that serves a lot of under-served and first-generation students, let me know and I will make sure you find the [job posting](https://jobs.uc.edu/job/Cincinnati-Endpoint-Administrator-2%2C-Digital-Technology-Solutions-OH-45201/1148407500/). You'll have a chance to do some really good work and maybe make a difference for a lot of people.

I'm also looking to leave my [autopkg children](https://github.com/lazymacadmin/UpdateTitleEditor) in someone's hands. In time, I'll archive the Github repository so that anyone who wants to can fork it, if I don't find someone who wants to take it over. 

I've learned a lot from this community. I've even given a little bit back. And while I can't pinpoint any one thing I've done to make this community dramatically better, I'd like to think my time as a Mac admin has been a net positive. And if not ... well, I'm gone anyway, right?
